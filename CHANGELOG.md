## 0.1.0 / 2020-08-31

* No more NFL.com parsing, using MySportsFeeds API instead. This will require users to acquire their own MySportsFeeds accounts and API tokens. Please see the README or [the MySportsFeeds website](https://www.mysportsfeeds.com for more details.

## 0.0.14 and previous

* This version and previous used Nokogiri to parse NFL.com. NFL has since changed their website and broken all of the parsing code. Any version before here probably won't work and should be upgraded.
